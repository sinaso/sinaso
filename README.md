One cool, open source project that I have worked on in the past, is a python async ORM named [tortoise-orm](https://github.com/tortoise/tortoise-orm). I have forked and heavily revamped and updated that project into something much more robust and easier to use, but never found the time to update the documentation and publicize it. Here is the [source code](https://github.com/nextfit/tortoise-orm). This updated ORM is used in the backend for our mobile app [TrendBoard](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.fifthstyle.mobile). 

Contact me if you are interested in this project!
